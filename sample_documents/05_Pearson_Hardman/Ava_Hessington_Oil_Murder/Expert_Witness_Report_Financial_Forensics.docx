- Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) 
- Certified in Financial Forensics (CFF)
- 25 years experience in financial investigations
- Former FBI Financial Crimes Unit Supervisor

ASSIGNMENT:
I was retained by Pearson Hardman LLP to analyze the financial records of Ava Hessington Oil Corporation ("AHO") for the period 2019-2024 to determine if payments to foreign officials violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

DOCUMENTS REVIEWED:
1. General ledger and subsidiary ledgers (2019-2024)
2. Bank statements for all corporate accounts
3. Wire transfer records and supporting documentation
4. Contracts with Libyan government entities
5. Board meeting minutes and resolutions
6. Audit working papers from PricewaterhouseCoopers
7. Internal compliance reports and policies
8. Email communications regarding Libyan operations

METHODOLOGY:
1. Data analytics on all transactions over $10,000
2. Analysis of payments to third-party consultants
3. Review of foreign exchange transactions
4. Examination of joint venture accounting
5. Testing of internal controls over financial reporting

KEY FINDINGS:

SUSPICIOUS PAYMENTS IDENTIFIED:
1. Mediterranean Consulting Services - $2.4 million
   - Described as "regulatory compliance consulting"
   - No evidence of actual services provided
   - Payments coincide with permit approvals

2. Tripoli Business Solutions - $1.8 million  
   - Characterized as "local partnership facilitation"
   - Principal is nephew of Libyan Oil Minister
   - Payments structured to avoid reporting thresholds

3. North Africa Development Corp - $3.2 million
   - Listed as "infrastructure development costs"
   - Funds traced to personal accounts of government officials
   - No corresponding infrastructure projects identified

FCPA VIOLATION INDICATORS:
- Payments to entities controlled by foreign officials
- Lack of legitimate business purpose for payments
- Circumvention of normal procurement processes
- Use of third-party intermediaries to obscure transactions
- Timing of payments correlates with regulatory approvals

INTERNAL CONTROL DEFICIENCIES:
1. Inadequate due diligence on third-party vendors
2. Lack of approval for high-risk country transactions
3. Insufficient documentation for consulting payments
4. No FCPA compliance training for international staff
5. Weak segregation of duties in accounts payable

FINANCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS:
Total questionable payments: $7.4 million
Estimated ill-gotten gains: $47.3 million (increased oil production)
Potential disgorgement and penalties: $94.6 million

MONEY FLOW ANALYSIS:
Funds originated from AHO operating accounts → 
Third-party consulting entities →
Personal accounts of Libyan officials and their families

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
Compared to industry standards, AHO's payments to consultants in Libya were:
- 340% higher than industry average
- Concentrated among entities with political connections
- Lacking typical consulting deliverables and reports

RED FLAGS IDENTIFIED:
1. Payments made in cash or to numbered accounts
2. Invoices lacking specific descriptions of services
3. Consultant agreements with unusual payment terms
4. Requests to pay consulting fees to different entities
5. Last-minute changes to payment instructions

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT:
The questionable payments were improperly recorded as:
- Professional services expense
- Regulatory compliance costs  
- Business development investments
- Joint venture contributions

Proper classification under FCPA should be:
- Illegal payments/bribes (not deductible)
- Contingent liabilities for penalties
- Impairment of related assets

OPINION:
Based on my analysis, there is substantial evidence that Ava Hessington Oil Corporation made payments totaling $7.4 million to foreign officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These payments were disguised as legitimate business expenses but lack documentation supporting actual services received.

The pattern of payments, timing with regulatory approvals, and lack of legitimate business purpose strongly suggest these were corrupt payments made to secure favorable treatment from Libyan government officials.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement comprehensive FCPA compliance program
2. Enhance due diligence procedures for foreign vendors
3. Strengthen internal controls over international payments
4. Provide mandatory FCPA training for all employees
5. Engage independent compliance monitor

I reserve the right to supplement this report based on additional documents or information that may become available.
