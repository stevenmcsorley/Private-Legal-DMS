SUMMARY OF EXAMINATION:

This examination was conducted pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 7602. The taxpayer's books and records were examined at the company's principal place of business in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

ISSUES EXAMINED:

1. DEPRECIATION OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT
The taxpayer claimed accelerated depreciation on manufacturing equipment totaling $2.3 million. Review of invoices and asset records indicates:

The taxpayer deducted $890,000 in "consulting fees" paid to Beneke Consulting LLC. Investigation reveals:
- Beneke Consulting is owned by taxpayer's CEO
- No evidence of actual consulting services provided
- Payments appear to be disguised compensation
- Related party transactions not properly documented

PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT: $267,000 additional tax

3. INVENTORY VALUATION METHODS
The taxpayer changed inventory accounting methods without filing Form 3115. Lower of cost or market method improperly applied resulting in understated income.

PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT: $178,000 additional tax

4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDITS
The taxpayer claimed R&D credits totaling $156,000 for activities that do not qualify under Section 41:
- Routine testing and quality control procedures
- Adaptation of existing processes
- Activities not meeting technological uncertainty requirement

PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT: $156,000 additional tax

5. PAYROLL TAX COMPLIANCE
Employment tax returns show discrepancies:
- Unreported employee benefits and perquisites
- Misclassification of independent contractors

PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT: $89,000 additional tax and penalties

TOTAL PROPOSED DEFICIENCY:

Tax Year 2020: $284,000
Tax Year 2021: $367,000
Tax Year 2022: $386,000
Total Additional Tax: $1,037,000

Accuracy-related penalties (20%): $207,400
Interest through examination date: $145,600
TOTAL AMOUNT DUE: $1,390,000

TAXPAYER RESPONSES:

The taxpayer, through counsel Saul Goodman & Associates, has disputed all proposed adjustments and requested Appeals Office consideration. Key arguments include:

1. Equipment depreciation based on manufacturer specifications
2. Consulting fees represent legitimate business expenses
3. Inventory methods consistent with industry practice
4. R&D activities meet all technical requirements
5. Payroll classifications based on IRS guidance

EXAMINER RECOMMENDATIONS:

Based on examination findings, the Service should:
1. Assess additional tax and penalties as proposed
2. Refer case to Criminal Investigation Division for potential fraud indicators
3. Expand examination to include tax years 2023-2024
4. Review related entities owned by taxpayer principals

CASE DEVELOPMENT:

The examination revealed significant compliance issues and potential indicators of tax fraud:
- Systematic underreporting of income
- Questionable deductions and credits
- Related party transactions lacking business purpose
- Inadequate books and records

The taxpayer's financial condition appears deteriorating based on:
- Declining revenue and profitability
- Increasing debt-to-equity ratios
- Late payments to creditors and employees
- Pending bankruptcy proceedings

COLLECTION POTENTIAL:

Given the taxpayer's financial distress and pending Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, collection of the full assessment may be doubtful. The Service should:
1. File proof of claim in bankruptcy proceeding
2. Coordinate with U.S. Trustee's office
3. Monitor reorganization plan proposals
4. Consider offer in compromise procedures

NEXT ACTIONS:

1. Issue 30-day letter with examination report
2. Schedule conference with taxpayer and counsel
3. Prepare case file for Appeals Office if protested
4. Coordinate with bankruptcy proceedings

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:

- General ledger and subsidiary records
- Bank statements and cancelled checks
- Invoices and contracts with related parties
- Employment records and payroll registers
- Asset purchase agreements and depreciation schedules
- Board meeting minutes and corporate resolutions
