PATENT APPLICATION FOR:
"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM FOR PREDICTIVE HEALTHCARE DIAGNOSTICS"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention:
This invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for medical diagnostics, specifically machine learning algorithms that analyze patient data to predict potential health conditions before clinical symptoms manifest.

Description of Related Art:
Current medical diagnostic systems rely primarily on reactive approaches, where patients seek treatment after symptoms appear. Existing AI diagnostic tools focus on interpreting medical images or lab results but lack comprehensive predictive capabilities that integrate multiple data sources.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides an artificial intelligence system that analyzes multiple patient data streams including:
- Electronic health records (EHR)
- Wearable device biometric data
- Genetic information
- Environmental factors
- Lifestyle data

The system employs deep learning neural networks to identify patterns that precede the onset of various medical conditions, enabling early intervention and preventive care.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The AI system comprises:
1. Data Collection Module - securely aggregates patient information from authorized sources
2. Pattern Recognition Engine - employs convolutional neural networks to identify risk patterns
3. Predictive Analytics Module - calculates probability scores for various health conditions
4. Alert System - notifies healthcare providers of high-risk patients
5. Privacy Protection Layer - ensures HIPAA compliance and data security

CLAIMS

1. An artificial intelligence system for predictive healthcare diagnostics comprising:
   a) a data collection module configured to receive patient data from multiple sources;
   b) a machine learning engine trained on historical medical outcomes;
   c) a prediction module that generates risk assessments for future health conditions;
   d) an alert system that notifies healthcare providers when risk thresholds are exceeded.

2. The system of claim 1, wherein the machine learning engine employs deep neural networks with at least three hidden layers.

3. The system of claim 1, wherein the data sources include electronic health records, wearable device data, and genetic information.

4. The system of claim 1, wherein the risk assessments include probability scores for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.

5. The system of claim 1, further comprising a privacy protection module that de-identifies patient data while preserving analytical value.

ABSTRACT

An artificial intelligence system for predictive healthcare diagnostics that analyzes multiple patient data streams to predict potential health conditions before clinical symptoms appear. The system employs machine learning algorithms to identify risk patterns and alert healthcare providers for early intervention opportunities.
