BUSINESS OVERVIEW:
Los Pollos Hermanos operates 14 restaurants across New Mexico and Arizona. Reported annual revenue has grown from $12.4M (2019) to $18.7M (2024). Principal owner Gustavo Fring reports personal income of $485K annually.

   - Multiple bank accounts with unusual activity patterns

2. EXPENSE IRREGULARITIES:
   - "Food costs" significantly higher than comparable restaurants
   - Vendor payments to shell companies with no apparent business purpose
   - Equipment purchases exceeding operational needs
   - Consulting fees to entities with no identifiable services

3. LIFESTYLE ANALYSIS:
   Gustavo Fring Personal Expenditures (2019-2024):
   - Real estate purchases: $3.2M (Los Alamos compound)
   - Luxury vehicles: $890K (Mercedes, BMW, Bentley)
   - Art and collectibles: $1.4M
   - Travel and entertainment: $670K
   - Charitable donations: $420K

   Q1 2024: $2.4M in deposits, $2.1M in withdrawals
   Q2 2024: $3.1M in deposits, $2.8M in withdrawals
   Q3 2024: $2.9M in deposits, $2.6M in withdrawals
   Q4 2024: $3.3M in deposits, $3.0M in withdrawals

   Pattern indicates cash business with high turnover, but deposit amounts exceed reasonable restaurant revenue.

   Madrigal Electromotive: $1.2M (described as "consulting")
   Los Hermanos Distribution: $2.1M (food distribution)

7. CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORTS:
   47 CTRs filed 2019-2024, all for amounts between $10K-$15K
