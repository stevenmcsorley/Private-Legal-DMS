TOXICOLOGY RESULTS:
Blood Digitalis Level: 4.2 ng/ml (therapeutic range: 0.8-2.0 ng/ml)
Blood Alcohol: Negative
Urine Drug Screen: Positive for digitalis, negative for other substances

MEDICATIONS FOUND AT SCENE:
1. Lanoxin (Digitalis) 0.25mg - prescribed by Dr. Michael Chen
2. Metoprolol 50mg - prescribed by Dr. Michael Chen  
3. Lisinopril 10mg - prescribed by Dr. Michael Chen

5. Aspirin 81mg - over the counter

MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Congestive heart failure diagnosed 2019
- Coronary artery disease
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Previous myocardial infarction 2020

DIGITALIS ANALYSIS:
The blood digitalis level of 4.2 ng/ml is more than twice the upper therapeutic limit. Digitalis (digoxin) is a narrow therapeutic window medication commonly used in heart failure patients. Levels above 2.0 ng/ml can cause severe cardiac arrhythmias leading to death.

POSSIBLE SCENARIOS:
1. Accidental overdose - Patient confusion about dosing
2. Intentional overdose - Suicide
3. Homicidal administration - Third party involvement
4. Medical error - Prescription or pharmacy error

INVESTIGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Interview prescribing physician regarding recent dosage changes
2. Verify pharmacy dispensing records for past 30 days
3. Test coffee cup and any remaining coffee for digitalis content
4. Interview family members about decedent's mental state
5. Review any recent medication changes or additions

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Cardiac tissue shows evidence of digitalis effect with characteristic cellular changes in myocardial fibers. No evidence of other toxic substances.

CONCLUSION:
Death resulted from digitalis intoxication causing fatal cardiac arrhythmia. The digitalis level found is consistent with either a significant accidental overdose or intentional administration of toxic amounts. Given the decedent's known heart condition and prescription for digitalis, further investigation is required to determine whether this was accidental, suicidal, or homicidal.

The manner of death remains PENDING INVESTIGATION pending completion of police investigation and review of additional evidence.
