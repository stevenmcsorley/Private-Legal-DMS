CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

TO:      Ben Matlock, Esq.
FROM:    Charlene Matlock, Investigator
DATE:    January 20, 2025
RE:      State of Georgia v. Martha Henderson - Defense Strategy

CASE OVERVIEW:
Martha Henderson is charged with the first-degree murder of her husband, Robert Henderson (age 67), who was found deceased in their Buckhead mansion on December 3, 2024. The prosecution alleges Mrs. Henderson poisoned her husband with digitalis to inherit his $15 million estate.

PROSECUTION'S THEORY:
- Financial motive: $15M life insurance policy and estate
- Means: Access to digitalis through her background as a nurse
- Opportunity: Alone with victim on night of death
- Evidence: Digitalis found in victim's coffee cup

DEFENSE STRATEGY:

I. ALTERNATIVE SUSPECT THEORY
Our investigation has identified Robert Henderson's business partner, Douglas Whitmore, as a viable alternative suspect:
- $2.3M embezzlement scheme Henderson discovered weeks before death
- Henderson scheduled meeting with accountants to review books
- Whitmore had access to digitalis through veterinary supplies (owns horse farm)
- Cell phone records place Whitmore near Henderson residence night of murder

II. MEDICAL DEFENSE
Dr. Patricia Ellis, cardiologist, will testify that:
- Victim had severe heart condition requiring multiple medications
- Drug interaction could have caused death without criminal intent
- Digitalis therapeutic window very narrow in elderly patients
- Accidental overdose more likely than intentional poisoning

III. CHARACTER EVIDENCE
Martha Henderson's exemplary character as registered nurse:
- 30-year career in pediatric oncology
- Multiple humanitarian awards
- No prior criminal history
- Devoted wife and mother (3 children, 7 grandchildren)

IV. TIMELINE ISSUES
Prosecution cannot establish precise time of death:
- ME estimates death between 8:00 PM - 12:00 AM
- Martha Henderson was at her daughter's house 7:00 PM - 11:30 PM
- Multiple witnesses confirm alibi
- Security cameras at daughter's residence confirm timeline

V. FORENSIC CHALLENGES
Chain of custody issues with coffee cup evidence:
- Cup not secured for 6 hours after discovery
- Multiple persons handled evidence before collection
- No fingerprint analysis conducted
- Coffee could have been contaminated post-mortem

WITNESS LIST:
1. Dr. Patricia Ellis - Medical expert
2. Sarah Henderson-Collins - Daughter (alibi witness)  
3. Douglas Whitmore - Alternative suspect (hostile)
4. Forensic expert TBD - Chain of custody issues
5. Character witnesses (5-7 colleagues and friends)

MOTIONS TO FILE:
- Motion to suppress coffee cup evidence (chain of custody)
- Motion for third-party guilt (Whitmore)
- Motion in limine to exclude prejudicial financial evidence
- Motion for change of venue (extensive pre-trial publicity)

INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES:
1. Subpoena Whitmore's veterinary supply records
2. Interview Henderson's accountant about embezzlement discovery
3. Obtain complete cell tower data for night of murder
4. Review victim's complete medical records
5. Background check on Detective Morrison (investigating officer)

TRIAL STRATEGY:
Focus jury on reasonable doubt regarding:
- Alternative suspect with stronger motive
- Medical explanation for death
- Timeline inconsistencies
- Character evidence showing Mrs. Henderson incapable of murder

The prosecution's case relies heavily on circumstantial evidence and assumptions about motive. Our alternative suspect theory, combined with medical testimony, should create sufficient reasonable doubt for acquittal.
