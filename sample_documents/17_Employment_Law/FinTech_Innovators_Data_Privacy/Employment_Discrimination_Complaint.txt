CAUSE(S) OF DISCRIMINATION CHECKED:

DATE(S) DISCRIMINATION TOOK PLACE:
Ongoing from June 15, 2024 through January 30, 2025

THE PARTICULARS OF THE ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION:

I was employed by FinTech Innovators Inc. as a Senior Software Engineer from March 1, 2023 until my termination on January 30, 2025. I believe I was discriminated against and ultimately terminated because of my sex (female), national origin (Mexican-American), and in retaliation for complaining about discriminatory treatment.

BACKGROUND:
I am a highly qualified software engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from UT Austin and 8 years of experience in financial technology. I was recruited by FinTech Innovators for my expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency systems.

DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT:

1. GENDER DISCRIMINATION:
From the beginning of my employment, I was subjected to a hostile work environment based on my gender:

- Male colleagues frequently made comments that women were not suited for complex technical work
- I was excluded from important technical meetings and decision-making processes
- My direct supervisor, David Chen, repeatedly questioned my technical capabilities despite my superior performance reviews
- I was assigned to less challenging projects than male colleagues with similar or lesser qualifications
- During team meetings, my ideas were often dismissed or credited to male team members

2. NATIONAL ORIGIN DISCRIMINATION:
I was subjected to discriminatory treatment based on my Mexican-American heritage:

- Colleagues made derogatory comments about my accent and asked if I was in the country legally
- I was stereotyped as being suited only for "manual labor" rather than intellectual work
- During the company Christmas party, a manager joked that I should be serving food rather than developing software
- My supervisor questioned whether I understood "American business practices"
- I was excluded from client meetings because executives felt clients would be more comfortable with "traditional" representatives

3. UNEQUAL PAY:
Through conversations with colleagues and review of salary information, I discovered that male employees in similar positions were being paid $15,000-$25,000 more annually than I was, despite my superior qualifications and performance.

4. HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT:
The discriminatory treatment created a hostile work environment including:

- Crude jokes and comments about women in technology
- Exclusion from after-work networking events
- Comments that I was probably hired to meet "diversity quotas"
- Isolation from team collaboration and communication
- Unrealistic performance expectations not imposed on male colleagues

PROTECTED ACTIVITY AND RETALIATION:

On June 15, 2024, I filed a formal complaint with Human Resources regarding the discriminatory treatment. I met with HR Director Jennifer Walsh and documented specific instances of discrimination.

Following my complaint, the retaliatory treatment escalated:

- I was suddenly placed on a "Performance Improvement Plan" despite having received excellent reviews
- My work was subjected to excessive scrutiny and micromanagement
- I was excluded from a high-profile project I had been leading
- My supervisor began documenting minor issues that had never been problems before
- Colleagues were instructed not to collaborate with me on projects
- I was transferred to a less desirable team working on legacy systems

TERMINATION:
On January 30, 2025, I was terminated, allegedly for "performance issues." This termination was pretextual and in retaliation for my discrimination complaint. The alleged performance issues were fabricated and inconsistent with my actual work quality and previous evaluations.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
- Performance reviews showing excellent ratings through May 2024
- Email communications documenting discriminatory comments
- Witness statements from colleagues who observed the discrimination
- Salary information showing pay disparities
- Documentation of HR complaints and company responses
- Records of project assignments and exclusions from meetings

SPECIFIC INSTANCES:

June 3, 2024: During a team meeting, Project Manager Steve Johnson stated that "we need someone with real programming skills, not someone who got their job through affirmative action" while looking directly at me.

July 18, 2024: I was removed from the blockchain development project and replaced by a less qualified male colleague who had been with the company for only 6 months.

August 22, 2024: At a client presentation, VP of Engineering Tom Wilson introduced all team members except me, later explaining that clients expect to see "the right kind of technical talent."

September 10, 2024: My supervisor David Chen told me that maybe I should consider "a career more suited to your background" when I requested training on new development frameworks.

November 15, 2024: HR Director Jennifer Walsh informed me that my discrimination complaint was "unfounded" and advised me to "focus on fitting in better with the team culture."

December 8, 2024: I discovered through a colleague that male engineers were receiving stock option grants that I had been excluded from receiving.

RELIEF SOUGHT:
1. Reinstatement to my former position or substantially equivalent position
2. Back pay and front pay compensation
3. Compensatory damages for emotional distress and humiliation
4. Adjustment of salary to eliminate pay discrimination
5. Attorney's fees and costs
6. Implementation of comprehensive anti-discrimination training
7. Revision of company policies to prevent future discrimination
8. Disciplinary action against supervisors and managers who engaged in discrimination

PREVIOUS PROCEEDINGS:
I filed complaints with the company's Human Resources department on June 15, 2024 and November 2, 2024. Both complaints were dismissed as "unsubstantiated" without adequate investigation.

I want this charge filed with both the EEOC and the Texas Workforce Commission - Civil Rights Division.

I will advise the agencies if I change my address or phone number and I will cooperate fully with them in the processing of my charge in accordance with their procedures.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the above is true and correct.
