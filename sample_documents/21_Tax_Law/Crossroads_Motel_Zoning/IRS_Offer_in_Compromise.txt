2. EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

The business faces exceptional circumstances that make full payment of the tax liability inequitable:

a) ZONING COMPLIANCE ISSUES:
The City of Albuquerque has issued multiple violations requiring:
- Upgraded fire safety systems ($125,000)
- ADA compliance modifications ($89,000)
- Parking lot resurfacing ($34,000)
- Landscaping and signage improvements ($67,000)
- Building facade renovation ($78,000)
Total required improvements: $393,000

Failure to complete these improvements within 180 days will result in:
- Revocation of business license
- Potential condemnation of property
- Forced closure of operations

b) FAMILY HARDSHIP:
The taxpayer's principal, Maria Santos, is the sole caretaker for:
- Elderly mother with dementia requiring full-time care
- Disabled adult son with cerebral palsy
- Medical expenses exceeding $4,500 monthly

c) ECONOMIC FACTORS:
- Local market conditions show continued decline in budget hotel demand
- Three competing properties opened within 2-mile radius since 2020
- Highway construction project diverted traffic for 18 months
- Loss of nearby anchor businesses affecting foot traffic

3. INABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS

Attempts to secure additional financing have been unsuccessful:
- Current debt-to-income ratio prevents additional bank loans
- Real property already encumbered by first mortgage
- Credit rating declined due to late tax payments
- SBA loan applications denied due to tax compliance issues

COLLECTION ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS:

Full Payment: Impossible given negative cash flow and required capital improvements

Payment Plan: Even minimum installment agreement would require $3,800 monthly payments, exceeding available cash flow by $4,610 monthly

Asset Liquidation: Forced sale of property would likely yield $650,000-$700,000 after marketing costs and mortgage satisfaction, leaving insufficient funds for tax liability

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:

1. Form 433-B (Collection Information Statement for Businesses)
2. Bank statements for past 12 months
3. Profit and loss statements (2022-2024)
4. Real estate appraisal dated January 15, 2025
5. Mortgage statements and loan documents
6. City of Albuquerque zoning violation notices
7. Contractor estimates for required improvements
8. Medical documentation for family members
9. Financial statements for competing hotels (market analysis)
10. Correspondence with lenders regarding loan denials
