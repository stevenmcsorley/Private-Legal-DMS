THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the beginning of the deposition of Dr. William Hayes taken on January 30, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in the law offices of Kinney & Associates, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York, in the matter of Peterson v. Lucky Strike Tobacco Company.

MR. KINNEY: Good morning, Dr. Hayes. Please state your name and spell your last name for the record.

THE WITNESS: William James Hayes, H-A-Y-E-S.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, you understand you're under oath today?

THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.

MR. KINNEY: And you understand that your testimony today has the same force and effect as if you were testifying in open court?

THE WITNESS: I understand.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, what is your current occupation?

THE WITNESS: I am retired. I was formerly the Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Research at Lucky Strike Tobacco Company from 1978 to 2010.

MR. KINNEY: During your tenure at Lucky Strike, were you involved in research regarding the health effects of cigarette smoking?

THE WITNESS: Yes, our research department conducted various studies on tobacco products and their effects.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, I'm showing you what's been marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 47. Do you recognize this document?

THE WITNESS: This appears to be an internal research memo dated March 15, 1982.

MR. KINNEY: And is that your signature at the bottom of page 3?

THE WITNESS: Yes, that's my signature.

MR. KINNEY: Would you please read aloud the highlighted paragraph on page 2?

THE WITNESS: "Our laboratory studies confirm that cigarette smoke contains at least 43 known carcinogenic compounds. The correlation between smoking duration and lung cancer development is statistically significant with p-values below 0.001. We recommend against public disclosure of these findings as they could impact market share and stockholder value."

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, did Lucky Strike ever publicly disclose these research findings?

MR. COOPER: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion and is beyond the scope of this witness's knowledge.

MR. KINNEY: I'll rephrase. Dr. Hayes, to your knowledge, did Lucky Strike ever publish or publicly release the research results described in Exhibit 47?

THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge, no.

MR. KINNEY: Why not?

THE WITNESS: The marketing department felt it would be commercially disadvantageous.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, were you present at the Tobacco Industry Research Committee meetings in the 1980s?

THE WITNESS: Yes, I attended many of those meetings on behalf of Lucky Strike.

MR. KINNEY: What was discussed at those meetings regarding health research?

MR. COOPER: Objection. Vague and overbroad.

MR. KINNEY: Let me be more specific. Were there discussions about coordinating research findings among tobacco companies?

THE WITNESS: There were discussions about... industry-wide approaches to research disclosure.

MR. KINNEY: What did those discussions involve?

THE WITNESS: The companies agreed to present a unified position that the health effects of smoking were not definitively established.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, was this position consistent with the research you were conducting at Lucky Strike?

THE WITNESS: [Long pause] It was consistent with our public position.

MR. KINNEY: But was it consistent with your internal research findings?

MR. COOPER: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE WITNESS: Our internal research showed correlations that we felt needed further study before drawing definitive conclusions.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, I'm showing you Exhibit 52, an internal email from you dated June 10, 1987. Can you read the third paragraph?

THE WITNESS: "The evidence is overwhelming that our products cause lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. We can no longer in good conscience deny the health risks. I recommend we begin developing safer alternatives immediately."

MR. KINNEY: Did Lucky Strike develop safer alternatives as you recommended?

THE WITNESS: There were some research projects, but nothing was brought to market during my tenure.

MR. KINNEY: Why not?

THE WITNESS: Cost considerations and concerns about admitting liability for existing products.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, when you retired in 2010, what was your opinion about the health effects of Lucky Strike cigarettes?

MR. COOPER: Objection. Calls for an opinion beyond his expertise.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes is a medical doctor with 32 years of tobacco research experience. I think he's qualified to give an opinion.

THE WITNESS: Based on our research, I believed then and believe now that Lucky Strike cigarettes cause serious health problems including lung cancer, emphysema, and cardiovascular disease.

MR. KINNEY: During your time at Lucky Strike, did you ever recommend warning labels stronger than those required by law?

THE WITNESS: Yes, I recommended several times that we include more specific health warnings on our packages.

MR. KINNEY: What was management's response?

THE WITNESS: They said it would be commercial suicide and that we shouldn't go beyond legal requirements.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, do you have any regrets about your work at Lucky Strike?

MR. COOPER: Objection. Irrelevant and calls for speculation.

MR. KINNEY: I think it goes to his credibility and potential bias.

THE WITNESS: I regret that we didn't do more to warn the public about health risks we had identified through our research.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, are you testifying here today under any agreement with Lucky Strike regarding your testimony?

THE WITNESS: No. I have no current relationship with Lucky Strike or any tobacco company.

MR. KINNEY: Have you been offered anything of value for your testimony today?

THE WITNESS: No, nothing.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, in your expert medical opinion, can cigarette smoking cause lung cancer?

THE WITNESS: Yes, absolutely.

MR. KINNEY: And based on your research at Lucky Strike, was this fact known to the company by 1982?

THE WITNESS: Yes, our research clearly showed the causal relationship by that time.

MR. KINNEY: Thank you, Dr. Hayes. I have no further questions.

MR. COOPER: Dr. Hayes, you mentioned that your recommendations for stronger warnings were rejected by management. You weren't responsible for marketing decisions, were you?

THE WITNESS: No, I was not.

MR. COOPER: And the research you conducted was preliminary and required peer review before publication, correct?

THE WITNESS: That was the company's position, yes.

MR. COOPER: Dr. Hayes, isn't it true that correlation doesn't necessarily prove causation?

THE WITNESS: In general scientific terms, that's correct.

MR. COOPER: So when you found correlations between smoking and disease, that didn't definitively prove causation, did it?

THE WITNESS: The weight of evidence, including our animal studies and epidemiological data, supported causal relationships.

MR. COOPER: But you're not an epidemiologist, are you Dr. Hayes?

THE WITNESS: No, but I worked with epidemiologists on our research team.

MR. COOPER: Dr. Hayes, during your 32 years at Lucky Strike, the company invested over $200 million in research, correct?

THE WITNESS: That sounds approximately correct.

MR. COOPER: And that research was aimed at developing safer products?

THE WITNESS: Some of it was, yes.

MR. COOPER: Dr. Hayes, you received substantial compensation from Lucky Strike over your career, didn't you?

THE WITNESS: I was well compensated, yes.

MR. COOPER: Including bonuses based on the company's profitability?

THE WITNESS: Performance bonuses were part of my compensation package.

MR. COOPER: So you financially benefited from Lucky Strike's success in the marketplace?

THE WITNESS: As did all employees through the profit-sharing program.

MR. COOPER: Dr. Hayes, you never resigned from Lucky Strike in protest over health issues, did you?

THE WITNESS: No, I did not resign in protest.

MR. COOPER: You worked there for 32 years until retirement age?

THE WITNESS: That's correct.

MR. COOPER: No further questions.

MR. KINNEY: Just a few follow-up questions, Dr. Hayes. When Mr. Cooper asked about proof of causation, you mentioned animal studies. What did those studies show?

THE WITNESS: Laboratory mice exposed to cigarette smoke developed lung tumors at significantly higher rates than control groups.

MR. KINNEY: And that was consistent across multiple studies?

THE WITNESS: Yes, the results were reproducible.

MR. KINNEY: Dr. Hayes, Mr. Cooper asked about your compensation. Did your compensation ever depend on concealing research results?

THE WITNESS: No, there were no explicit bonuses for concealing research.

MR. KINNEY: But you understood that revealing harmful research could affect company profitability and potentially your job security?

THE WITNESS: That was the implicit understanding, yes.

MR. KINNEY: Thank you. No further questions.

(DEPOSITION CONCLUDED AT 3:47 P.M.)
