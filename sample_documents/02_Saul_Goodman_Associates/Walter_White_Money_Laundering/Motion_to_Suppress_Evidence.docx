UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
                                    Plaintiff,
v.                                                    Case No. 1:24-cr-00892-JB

WALTER HARTWELL WHITE,
                                    Defendant.

DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OBTAINED 
IN VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT

TO THE HONORABLE JAMES O. BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE:

COMES NOW Defendant Walter Hartwell White, by and through his undersigned counsel, and hereby moves this Honorable Court for an Order suppressing all evidence obtained as a result of unlawful searches and seizures conducted by law enforcement agencies in violation of Defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On September 7, 2010, agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") executed a search warrant at defendant's residence located at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico. The search was conducted without proper constitutional safeguards and in violation of clearly established law.

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

1. The search warrant was obtained based primarily on information provided by Jesse Bruce Pinkman, a co-conspirator seeking leniency in his own pending criminal charges.

2. The affidavit supporting the search warrant failed to establish the reliability of Mr. Pinkman's statements and contained material misrepresentations.

3. DEA Agent Hank Schrader had a personal relationship with the defendant as his brother-in-law, creating a conflict of interest that tainted the investigation.

4. The warrant was overbroad and failed to particularly describe the items to be seized as required by the Fourth Amendment.

III. ARGUMENT

A. The Search Warrant Was Based on Unreliable Information

The Supreme Court has held that a magistrate must make a practical, common-sense decision whether probable exists based on the totality of the circumstances. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983).

Here, the affidavit relied primarily on statements from Jesse Pinkman, who had clear motivation to fabricate or exaggerate information to benefit his own legal situation. The agents failed to corroborate Pinkman's claims through independent investigation.

B. Agent Schrader's Conflict of Interest Tainted the Investigation

Agent Schrader's personal relationship with the defendant created an inherent conflict that compromised the integrity of the investigation. His emotional investment in the case led to constitutional violations that require suppression of the evidence.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that this Court suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful search conducted on September 7, 2010.

Respectfully submitted,
