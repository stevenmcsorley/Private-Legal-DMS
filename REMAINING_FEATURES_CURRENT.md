## ‚ùå CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline (CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: Infrastructure exists but processing pipeline not connected

**Missing Components**:
- **Worker Service**: `/services/worker/` directory exists but is completely empty
- **File Upload to Storage**: No actual file upload to MinIO implementation
- **Virus Scanning Integration**: ClamAV running but not connected to upload flow
- **Text Extraction**: Tika service unhealthy and not integrated
- **OCR Processing**: OCRmyPDF service commented out in docker-compose
- **Search Indexing**: No pipeline from document processing to OpenSearch

**Technical Issues**:
- Tika service showing as unhealthy in Docker
- No queue processing implementation despite Redis being available
- Upload endpoints exist but don't store actual files

**Impact**: Users cannot upload, store, or process documents - core DMS functionality missing

---

### 2. User & Firm Management (CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: Modules exist but are empty shells

**Missing Implementation**:
```typescript
// users.module.ts
@Module({
  // TODO: Implement user management
})
export class UsersModule {}

// firms.module.ts  
@Module({
  // TODO: Implement firm management
})
export class FirmsModule {}
```

**Missing Components**:
- User CRUD operations and endpoints
- Firm creation and management
- User registration/invitation flow
- Multi-firm onboarding process
- User attribute and role management UI

**Current Limitation**: All users must be manually created in Keycloak and database

**Impact**: Cannot onboard new firms or manage users through the application

---

### 3. Role-Based Access Control Enforcement (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current Status**: Roles defined in Keycloak but enforcement incomplete

**Security Gaps** (per `RBAC_SPECIFICATION.md`):

#### Client Users (`client_user`)
- ‚ùå **SECURITY BUG**: Can access all documents instead of only assigned matters
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Upload to designated inbox
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Matter-based document filtering

#### External Partners (`external_partner`)
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Time-boxed access to shared matters
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Cross-firm document access restrictions
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Expiry-based access control

#### Support Staff (`support_staff`)
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Upload-only permissions
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Limited document access
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: No policy change restrictions

#### Legal Managers (`legal_manager`)
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Team supervision capabilities
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Cross-team matter management

**Impact**: Significant security vulnerabilities and improper access control

---

### 4. Document Upload and File Storage (CRITICAL)

**Current Status**: UI exists but backend not implemented

**Missing Components**:
- Actual file upload to MinIO storage
- Chunked/resumable upload implementation
- File deduplication by SHA-256
- Version management for documents
- File download streaming from MinIO
- Preview generation pipeline

**Technical Debt**:
- `TODO: Change to application/zip when archiver is implemented` in matter export
- Matter export service incomplete
- No actual file storage integration

**Impact**: Core document management functionality non-functional

---

- ‚ùå Audit trail inclusion
- `TODO: implement access tracking` in shares.service.ts:51

### Cross-Firm Sharing
**Status**: Database schema and OPA policies ready, workflow incomplete

- ‚úÖ OPA policies for cross-firm access
- ‚úÖ Basic sharing service
- ‚úÖ UI components for sharing

**Missing**:
- External partner user registration flow

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Infrastructure is Solid**: All core services are running and most are healthy
2. **Frontend is Complete**: UI components exist for most features
3. **Backend APIs Exist**: Controller endpoints are implemented
4. **Missing Integration**: Services exist but aren't connected to each other
5. **Security Gaps**: RBAC defined but not enforced
6. **Document Pipeline**: Core functionality completely missing

The system has excellent architectural foundation but needs the document processing pipeline and user management to be functional for production use.

## üö® Critical Path to MVP

1. **Fix Tika Service** (1 day)
2. **Implement Document Upload Pipeline** (1-2 weeks)
3. **Complete User/Firm Management** (1 week)
4. **Fix Security Vulnerabilities** (1 week)
