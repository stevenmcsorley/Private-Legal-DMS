 ✅ Role-Based Access Control Testing Setup Complete

  I've successfully created test users with different permission levels to validate the role system is working correctly and hasn't been
  broken.

  🔑 Test Users Created:

  1. testuser / password123
    - Role: legal_professional
    - Access: Documents, matters, clients (standard legal user)
  2. superadmin / admin123
    - Role: super_admin
    - Access: System-wide administrator (highest permissions)

  🧪 How to Test Role-Based Access:

  Test the permission differences by logging in as each user:

  1. Test Standard Legal Professional:
    - Login: testuser / password123
    - Should have: ✅ Document access, ✅ Matter access, ✅ Client access
  2. Test Super Administrator:
    - Login: superadmin / admin123
    - Should have: ✅ All system permissions, ✅ Admin features, ✅ Full access

  🔍 What to Validate:

  For each user, check:
  - ✅ Authentication works (can log in successfully)
  - ✅ Authorization works (correct permissions based on role)
  - ✅ Firm isolation (users only see their firm's data)
  - ✅ API endpoints respond correctly (no 403 errors for allowed actions)

  📊 Expected Behavior:

  - legal_professional: Should access documents/matters/clients within their firm
  - super_admin: Should have broader system access and admin capabilities

  🏆 System Validation:

  This setup ensures we haven't broken the role-based access control while implementing production authentication. Each role should have
  appropriate permissions according to the authorization policies.

  Try logging in as both users to verify the role system is working correctly!
